# BitCode
ðŸš€ A modern Code Editor

<h2>Developing</h2>
Here's how to install the dependencies and run the editor locally:
<pre>
$ npm install</pre>

<p>To build the editor, run:</p>
<pre>
$ npm start</pre>

This will compile all scripts and styles and inline them into a single html file in the dist/ folder. It will also create a dist/assets/ folder, which separately contains the instructions and page screenshot so that they can easily be changed between different rounds of the competition.
