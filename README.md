# BitCode
ðŸš€ A modern Code Editor

<h2>Developing</h2>
Here's how to install the dependencies and run the editor locally:
<pre>
$ npm install</pre>

<p>To run the editor, run:</p>
<pre>
$ npm start</pre>

## Building
To build BitCode you need:
- A clone/release of BitCode

For building we use yarn. To use yarn you first need to install it:
<pre>
$ npm install -g yarn</pre>

<p>To build the project, run:</p>
<pre>
$ yarn build</pre>

This will compile all scripts and styles and inline them into a single html file in the build/ folder. It will also create a build/ folder, which makes supporting files for the build.

<h2> Storyboard</h2>
  <pre>
  - Create project (âœ”)
  - Make a react app (âœ”)
  - Make a basic layout(âœ”)
  - Create option to import file content and save it again
  - Mark code initialization with color
