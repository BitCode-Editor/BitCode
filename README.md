<h1 align="center">  BitCode</h1>
<br>
<p align="center">ðŸš€ A modern Code Editor.</p>
<br>
<p>To use BitCode you need to follow the steps of developing. Developing is intended to be a flexible code editor that can be used in the browser aswell as a applicaton. At this moment BitCode is still in development. To get a preview you can clone this repo and build it yourself. We hope that BitCode will be a great source where you can edit your files and make your own projects</p>

<h2>Developing</h2>
Here's how to install the dependencies and run the editor locally:
<pre>
$ npm install
$ npm install -g yarn</pre>

<p>To run the editor, run:</p>
<pre>
$ npm start</pre>

<p>To build the project, run:</p>
<pre>
$ yarn build</pre>

This will compile all scripts and styles and inline them into a single html file in the build/ folder. It will also create a build/ folder, which makes supporting files for the build.

<h2>Supported Languages</h2>
<p>Not yet finalized</p>
<p>Planned:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>HTML</li>
   <li>JavaScript</li>
   <li>TypeScript</li>
   <li>JSON</li>
   <li>PHP</li></ul>

<h2> Storyboard</h2>
  <pre>
  - Create project (âœ”)
  - Make a react app (âœ”)
  - Make a basic layout(âœ”)
  - Create option to import file content and save it again
